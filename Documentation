This package contains code discretizing certain integral equations on
planar domains with corner points.  The following files comprise the
package:

1.  The file print.f contains the output routines which are used throughout
the solver.

2.  The file utils.f contains a few basic utility routines (e.g., subroutines
for sorting).

3.  The file plot.f provides rudimentry plotting facilities. 

4.  The file qrsolv.f contains a code of V. Rokhlin for solving linear systems
of equations via the QR decomposition.

4.  The file legendre.f contains code for constructing Gauss-Legendre
quadratures and for manipulating Legendre expansions.  It is a slightly
modified version of V. Rokhlin's legeexps.f.

5.  The file arcmap.f contains code for producing parameterization independent
quadratures on planar curves.  In particular, it contain a subroutine for mapping 
quadratures specified in the arclength variable to those given in a user-
specified parameterization variable.  It is a slightly modified version of 
V. Rokhlin's anaresa code.

6.  The file hank103.f contains V. Rokhlin's code for the evaluation of
Hankel functions of the first kind of order 0 and 1.

7.  The file kernels.f contains routines for evaluating the kernels of various
integral operators associated with the boundary value problems of scattering
theory.  These routines are *unaccelerated* --- that is, they evaluate Hankel 
functions naively.

8.  The file curves.f contains routines which supply parameterizations of 
various planar domains with corners.  It includes, among other things, routines
for generating planar domains with a single corner point with angle specified
by the user.

9.  The file discretize.f contains a simple code for discretizing integral 
operators whose kernels are logarithmically singular and which are given on
planar domains with corners points.
